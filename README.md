# Pinterest Design Study
How do you recreate the popular platform, Pinterest?

## Description
This project is my attempt to learn effective front-end and back-end development by mimic-ing the workings of one of my favorite websites. I have recreated the project in two different ways: stylistically through HTML/CSS and functionally through Node/React/Express/SQLite3.

As I work more and more on this project, I continuously add more complex features. Recently, I have experimented and correctly implemented both offset-based and cursor-based pagination, seed files for my image database, state in React, @emotion/css implementation, and flex-box/ grid layouts. I am currently working on deploying a neural network and machine learning to mimic search-bar querying and recommendation techniques.
